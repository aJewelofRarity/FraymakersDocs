# Fraymakers API Docs & Community Help

This repository contains the scripting API documentation for the game [Fraymakers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1420350/Fraymakers/). The goal of these docs is to provide an extensive list of all available functions and variables available for custom Fraymakers content creation. Everything here is still a work in progress and will be gradually updated over time.
