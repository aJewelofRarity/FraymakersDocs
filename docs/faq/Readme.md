## What does "assets with conflicting GUIDs" mean and how would I fix that?

When an entity is created in Fraytools it is assigned a unique GUID if you were to somehow have a file with an identical GUID either by complete chance or by duplicating the entity you would end up with two entities that contain the same GUID resulting in the message "assets with conflicting GUIDs" to avoid this you will wan't create entities from scratch, if a method is found to refresh the GUID of a file to assign a new one this will be updated with that info.
